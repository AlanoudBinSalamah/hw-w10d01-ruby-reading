## *Congratulations on making it through Project Three!*

We've spent the majority of the course learning how to write JavaScript that performs logic in the **client**, as well as how to create our **server**. Next, we're going to begin learning **Ruby**.

## Right Now: Ask Yourself...

If you were going to learn a new programming language, what questions would you have? You've already learned one programming language, and you're about to learn another! Think about the things you now know how to do in JavaScript. With this knowledge, consider what you might want to know about Ruby. Take a few minutes to think about some questions that you have about this new language.

#### Examples:

- How do I define a variable in Ruby? Is it different than in JavaScript?
- Where do I go for information about Ruby? What kind of documentation exists for it?
- Does Ruby have functions?

## Tonight: Explore

To kick off our journey with Ruby, we're going to do some light required reading tonight.  For this we'll be reading [Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby](http://poignant.guide/).  This book/comic is a pretty big deal in the Ruby community, and the little cartoon foxes are both adorable and knowledgable.  Tonight we're reading chapters 1, 2 and 3.  Feel free to read further if you want!

[chapter 1](http://poignant.guide/book/chapter-1.html)
[chapter 2](http://poignant.guide/book/chapter-2.html)
[chapter 3](http://poignant.guide/book/chapter-3.html)


If you're interested in exploring further, you may also find the first few levels of [Codecademy's Ruby course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby) a useful introduction to the language.

Most importantly, come to class on tomorrow full of thoughtful questions and curiosity!

## Additionally: Deploy your app!  
If your group did not deploy the project, get that done tonight!  Once your group has it deployed, slack Trevor, Jackie or Ghadeer with your links so we can update the sheet.

Getting it online is important so that we can show our apps to other people (and potential employers)!
